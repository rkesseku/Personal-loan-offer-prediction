# Customer retention is of paramount importance to banks, as it directly impacts their profitability, growth, and overall success. Banks strive to build strong and lasting relationships with their customers by offering personalized services, superior customer experiences, and competitive products and incentives. By understanding customer needs and preferences, banks can tailor their programs to provide targeted financial solutions. Such strategies include proactive communication, personalized marketing campaigns, loyalty programs, and exceptional customer service. Thera Bank, a financial institution, aims to maximize its conversion of liability customers into personal loan customers while ensuring their retention as depositors. In this study, we develop a state-of-the-art classification model that best predicts personal loan acceptance. The statistically important variables are highlighted accordingly to guide decision-making processes.
